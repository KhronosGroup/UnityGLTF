All notable changes to this package will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.14.1] - 2024-10-28

- fix: compiler error with `ParticleSystemBakeMeshOptions` before 2022.3.11f1 since that's where the API was introduced
- fix: prevent incorrect warning when meshes don't have UV1/UV2 attributes
- fix: don't call export multiple times from context menu for multi-selections
- fix: remove unused property from `GLTFComponent`

## [2.14.0] - 2024-10-06

- fix: potential NullReferenceExceptions when importing material-only, mesh-only or texture-only glTF files
- fix: check for missing primitives on mesh import instead of throwing
- fix: GLTFSceneImporter reference counting properly tracks Animation data now
- fix: incorrect callback subscription in glTF Material editing
- fix: CanvasExport plugin was not working correctly in WebGL builds
- fix: rare case of incorrect texture export with invalid texture content hash (thanks @Vaso64)
- fix: ensure materials created with Create > UnityGLTF > Material use UnityGLTF as importer instead of glTFast
- fix: Canvas export plugin was not correctly updating the canvas mesh in builds
- fix: Particle Bake export plugin was not working correctly in 2022.3
- fix: Import/Export plugin enabled/disabled state was not correctly serialized in some cases
- fix: TMPro export plugin uses UnityGLTF shaders for export now instead of adding another dependency
- fix: GLTFSceneImporter can be called without external data loader, but will warn that external data will not be loaded. Previously, a data loader had to be added even when it was not needed.
- change: log warning when exporting UV0 and UV1 with more than 2 components, as glTF only supports 2-component UVs
- change: simplify sampler usage in PBRGraph where possible to prevent warnings in later Unity versions
- change: simplify PBRGraph variants to reduce shader variant count. This removes a separate option to use vertex color.
- change: material-only files are now imported as MaterialLibrary assets with Material sub-assets, even when only a single material is present
- add: log more meaningful exception messages on import
- add: sheen support for PBRGraph
- add: PBRGraph UI properly shows sheen and dispersion properties
- add: allow flipping humanoid root bone on import to support more avatar types (like Meta Avatars)
- add: new "Info" tab in GLTFImporter for asset information (generator, copyright, etc.) about the imported file
- add: ShaderOverride is now public on GLTFComponent
- add: new GLTFSceneImporter constructor overload for easier loading of files from streams
- add: meshes and textures can now be deduplicated on import, since many exporters don't properly instance them
- add: UV2 is exported as 2-, 3-, or 4-component texture coordinate. 3- and 4-component texture coordinates are not in the core glTF spec, but widely supported by implementations.
- add: complete PBRGraph and UnlitGraph Shader Variant Collections for easier runtime import and export of glTF files
- add: options for shader pass stripping in builds to reduce variant count and compilation times
- add: ability to export a set of materials as material-only glTF or glb file
- add: option to add new materials to glTF Material Libraries (material-only files)

### Release Candidate
UnityGLTF has been maintained in a fork since the end of 2019.  
Hundreds of fixes have been made, numerous features have been added, and the library has been brought up-to-speed on latest glTF developments,
modern material extensions, and Unity versions. We're happy to bring these changes back to the main repository so everyone can benefit.  

UnityGLTF has turned into an extremely versatile glTF exporter _and_ importer, which excellent support for data roundtrips and glTF-first workflows in Unity.  

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/UnityGLTF/issues) if you find any problems with the release candidate.
